Subject:
- general principle: be as specific as possible, but send just one email
- if multiple bills changed:
---- $count bills were updated

- if just a single bill changed
---- if status changed: Intro 2317 status changed to "Enacted"
---- if gained a sponsor: Intro 2317 gained sponsor $name
---- if lost a sponsor: Intro 2318 lost sponsor $name
---- if gained and lost: Intro 2317 sponsors changed

 But... don't start off too specific
 
 BODY:
